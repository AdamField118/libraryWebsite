It then explores the generation of initial fluctuations by inflation. In the following chapters the Boltzmann equation, which governs the evolution of CMB anisotropies, and polarization are derived using the total angular momentum method. Cosmological parameter estimation is discussed in detail. The lensing of CMB fluctuations and spectral distortions are also treated.",
